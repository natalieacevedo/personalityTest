## Description
I built this project using React.JS and SASS for styling. The projects follows a flow where the user is taken to the next screen by pressing buttons that change the state of the application. I did not see a need to use React Router because the inner pages depend on the main state, all users neccesarily need to start in the main page. I also did not use any libraries or external resources. Prettier was use to format the code.
<br>
For each of the features of the app, I created a branch locally that was later merged into the main branch ; then I pushed the code to Github. I attempted to comment on the code to explain the purpose of the functions and variables. I also tried to name them as descriptively as possible.

## If I had more time I would to change ...
Definetely  the styling and perhaps the logic on the results component. Adittionaly, althought the application is responsive, it resposiveness could definetely be improved.
